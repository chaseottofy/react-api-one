# rss-parser-demo

This is a simple demo using the `rss-parser` package to parse RSS feeds.

Recreated the homepage of hacker news using their RSS feed, Only the top 30 articles are loaded, and all of the buttons are just for show aside from the article links. Uses a proxy to get around CORS issues.

No authentication needed.
