# rss-parser-demo

Simple clone of the front page of hacker news using RSS as the data source, built with React, Typescript, and rss-parser.

Loads the top 30 stories, minimal functionality but the title links work.
Uses the heroku cors-anywhere proxy to get around CORS issues. 
Just a demo - will not be building this out further.
